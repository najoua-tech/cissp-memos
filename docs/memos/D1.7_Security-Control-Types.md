## 🧱 D1.7 – Security Control Types & Functions (🇬🇧 / 🇫🇷)

This memo summarizes the **types and functionalities** of security controls used to protect systems and organizations.

## 🔒 Categories of Controls

| Category                                               | Description                              | Examples                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Administrative** (a.k.a. managerial / soft controls) | Policies and processes set by management | Security policies, hiring practices, training, background checks |
| **Technical** (a.k.a. logical controls)                | Implemented via hardware/software        | Firewalls, access control lists, encryption, passwords           |
| **Physical**                                           | Protect people, facilities, and hardware | Fences, locks, guards, CCTV, doors                               |

🧠 _FR : Les contrôles peuvent être de type administratif (gestion), technique (IT) ou physique (bâtiment, personnes)._

## ⚙️ Functional Types of Controls

| Function         | Purpose                                          | Examples                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Preventive**   | Stop an incident from occurring                  | Locks, firewalls, biometrics, security policies |
| **Detective**    | Detect when something went wrong                 | CCTV, IDS, audit logs, alarms                   |
| **Corrective**   | Fix damage after an incident                     | Backups, patching, restoring systems            |
| **Deterrent**    | Dissuade potential attackers                     | Warning signs, fences, lighting, fake cameras   |
| **Recovery**     | Restore operations after disruption              | DRP, system rebuilds, data recovery             |
| **Compensating** | Alternate control when ideal one is not possible | Temporary access control, isolation zone        |

🧠 _FR : Chaque contrôle a une **fonction** : empêcher, détecter, corriger, dissuader, restaurer ou compenser._

## 🧾 CISSP Example – What is a Fence?

| Attribute | Type                       |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Category  | Physical                   |
| Functions | Preventive ✅ Deterrent ✅ |

Fences block access (preventive) and signal “stay out” (deterrent), but don’t detect intrusion on their own.

| Security Guard   | Physical  | Preventive + Detective         |
| Antivirus        | Technical | Preventive + Detective         |
| Backups          | Technical | Corrective + Recovery          |
| Warning Sign     | Admin     | Deterrent                      |
| DRP              | Admin     | Recovery                       |
| Audit Logs       | Technical | Detective                      |

## 💡 Tip for Exam

Ask:

- ❓ “What is the goal of this control?”
- 🧠 “What kind of control delivers that?”

🔄 Many controls have **multiple functions**.  
Example: CCTV can be detective (real-time monitoring) or recovery (forensic review).

## 🛡️ Defense in Depth

**Defense in Depth** is a layered security strategy that uses multiple types of controls to protect assets.

🔄 Principle:

> "What you can't prevent, you should detect.  
> What you detect, you should correct."

| Layer  | Example Control Types                                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outer  | 🔒 Fences, signs, guards (Physical)                         |
| Middle | 🔐 Authentication, firewalls, ACLs (Technical)              |
| Inner  | 🔍 Logging, monitoring, backups (Administrative & Recovery) |

🧠 _FR : Défense en profondeur = plusieurs couches de sécurité. Si une barrière échoue, une autre prendra le relais._

## ✅ CISSP Exam Tip

> ❗ You can’t rely on just one control. Use **redundant, layered** protection.

- Ex: Badge access + CCTV + logs = better protection
- Use **Preventive + Detective + Corrective** together
