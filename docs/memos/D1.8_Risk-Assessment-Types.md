## ⚖️ D1.8 – Risk Assessment Types & ALE (🇬🇧 / 🇫🇷)

This memo explains the **types of risk assessments** used in CISSP, and how to apply the **ALE formula** to quantify risk.

---

## 📊 Risk Assessment Methods

### 🔹 Qualitative Risk Assessment

- Uses **subjective judgment** (High / Medium / Low)
- Based on **impact, likelihood, threat ranking**
- Quick, requires less data
- Often displayed using **risk matrices**

🧠 _FR : Utilise des échelles d’impact et de probabilité (élevé, moyen, faible)._

---

### 🔹 Quantitative Risk Assessment

- Uses **numerical data** and $$$
- Calculates actual **financial risk** and potential loss
- Based on 3 key metrics: **SLE**, **ARO**, **ALE**

🧠 _FR : Évaluation chiffrée, utilisée pour budgétiser la gestion du risque._

## 💡 Use Cases

| Method        | When to use                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantitative  | For tangible assets (servers, buildings, equipment) |
| Qualitative   | For intangible assets (brand, reputation, goodwill) |
| Hybrid (both) | ✅ Recommended in real-life scenarios and CISSP     |

## 🔢 ALE Formula (Annualized Loss Expectancy)

To calculate the **expected annual cost** of a risk:

```text
ALE = SLE × ARO
```

Where:

    SLE = Single Loss Expectancy
    → Cost of one occurrence of the incident

    ARO = Annual Rate of Occurrence
    → How often the incident is expected per year

🧾 Example (Tangible Asset)

    A ransomware attack on a file server causes €25,000 in damage.
    It is expected to occur once every 4 years.

🎯 Step-by-step:

    SLE = €25,000

    ARO = 0.25 (because once every 4 years)

📘 ALE = €25,000 × 0.25 = €6,250/year

🧠 FR : Cela permet de comparer le coût annuel d’un risque avec le coût d’un contrôle.

🧾 Extended Example (Warehouse + Fire)

    A company has a data warehouse valued at $150,000.
    If a fire occurs, it is expected to damage 25% of the warehouse.
    The frequency of such an event is once every 10 years.

Step 1 – Calculate SLE:

SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
SLE = 150,000 × 0.25 = $37,500
🧠 This means one fire would cause a $37,500 loss.

Step 2 – Calculate ALE:
ARO = 1 / 10 = 0.1
ALE = SLE × ARO = $37,500 × 0.1 = $3,750/year

✅ This means the company expects to lose $3,750 per year due to fire.

📌 Interpretation:
The company should not spend more than $3,750 annually on countermeasures (like sprinklers, fireproofing, etc.),
otherwise it would cost more to prevent the risk than to accept it.

🧠 FR : L’ALE représente la perte annuelle estimée. L’entreprise ne devrait pas dépenser plus de 3 750 $ par an pour se protéger contre cette menace.

❗ When ARO = 1

If the incident is expected to occur once per year, then:
ALE = SLE × 1 = SLE

📘 Quick Comparison Table
Metric Description Example
SLE Loss per event €10,000
ARO Frequency per year 0.5 (every 2 years)
ALE Expected loss/year €5,000
💡 CISSP Tip

    If the question uses monetary values, it’s quantitative

    If the question uses High/Medium/Low, it’s qualitative

    If the scenario mixes tangible/intangible → ✅ use both
